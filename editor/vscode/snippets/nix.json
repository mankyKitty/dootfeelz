	// Place your snippets for nix here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {

	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
